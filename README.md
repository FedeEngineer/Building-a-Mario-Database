# Relational Database Project: Mario Database :video_game:

## Description :memo:

This project was created as part of a 165-lesson course on relational databases. 
The goal was to learn the fundamentals of relational databases by creating a PostgreSQL database filled with characters from the Mario video game franchise. 
The project covers essential concepts such as table creation, relationships, and querying using SQL.

## Technologies Used :wrench:

- PostgreSQL 
- SQL :floppy_disk:
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) :computer:
- Data Modeling :triangular_ruler:

## Project Structure :file_folder:

The database is organized into the following tables, with relationships between them:

- **Characters**: Contains information about each character.
- **Games**: Information about the Mario games featured in the database.
- **PowerUps**: Details about different power-ups in the Mario series.
- **Enemies**: Data about enemies encountered in various Mario games.

Example schema:
/mario-database ├── characters ├── games ├── powerups └── enemies

## Usage :wrench:
This database serves as a practical example to learn how to organize data using relational concepts.
You can run queries to interact with the database, explore relationships, and manipulate the data
(e.g., finding all enemies from a specific game or listing characters who use a particular power-up).

## Features :sparkles:
* A relational database model with tables and relationships representing Mario game data.
*Contains data on characters, games, power-ups, and enemies.
*Examples of complex queries to practice SQL skills.
